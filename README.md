# CrimeIntent
This is an Android App project that I followed the Android Big Nerd Ranch written by Phillips Bill published in 2007. Beside the tutorial, I finished most of the challenges after every chapter, which doesn't have code in the book.

The basic function of this app is using camera to take pictures, using Recycle View and Adapter to display list, using ViewPager to switch between items and using Android Widget to allow user to choose date and time.
